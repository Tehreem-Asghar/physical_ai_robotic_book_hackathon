- Safety: All instructions for hardware use (robots, Jetson kits) must highlight safe handling.
Key Standards:
- Citations: All claims must cite credible sources (APA format).
- Code & Simulation: Include tested, verified code examples for ROS2, Gazebo, Isaac, and VLA.
- Plagiarism: Zero tolerance; no copied text without citations.                                                                                                                    - Hardware instructions: Must include safety and setup notes.                                                                                                                            -Constraints:
- Format: Markdown compatible with Docusaurus.
- Accessibility: Include diagrams, tables, and step-by-step instructions.
- Language: English (with optional Urdu translation later).

Success Criteria:
- Every module has verifiable sources and working code examples.
- Safety instructions for all hardware included.
- Readable for target audience (senior CS / robotics students).
- Ready to generate specifications for each chapter.
